		<logic>The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using either tools in ArcGIS or ESRI SDC Data Development Kit Professional 2 (DDKP2).  The SDC data set is then imported into a file geodatabase to verify and validate the geometry.  The data set is created directly from a topologically correct ArcInfo® coverage.</logic>
		<complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>

				<horizpar>The horizontal accuracy, at a 90 percent confidence level for circular error, ranges from 1,600 feet to 7,300 feet.  These figures are the root sum square of Operational Navigation Chart (ONC)/Jet Navigation Chart (JNC) sheet positional errors plus the additional error introduced by the Digital Chart of the World production process.

Since the features are derived from annotation, they do not correspond with the true location because the latitude and longitude coordinate values were derived from the annotation location rather than the map feature itself. Locations taken from annotation are based on the lower left corner of the first letter.  Also, the names associated with fuzzy polygons may occur anywhere in the general area of the feature.  For example, the name 'Rocky Mountains' is a point located somewhere in the general area covered by the term Rocky Mountains.  Fuzzy polygon names, which appeared on more than one ONC sheet, will occur more than once.</horizpar>
