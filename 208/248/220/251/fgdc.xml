			<abstract>This point dataset shows law enforcement locations in New Hampshire.  

Any location where sworn officers of a law enforcement agency are regularly based or stationed. Law Enforcement agencies "are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers". This is the definition used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Although LEMAS only includes non Federal Agencies, this dataset includes locations for federal, state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies.

Law enforcement agencies include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, state police, school police, park police, railroad police, federal law enforcement agencies, departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement (e.g., US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g., Port Authority Police).

In general, the requirements and training for becoming a sworn law enforcement officer are set by each state. Law Enforcement agencies themselves are not chartered or licensed by their state. County, city, and other government authorities within each state are usually empowered by their state law to setup or disband Law Enforcement agencies. Generally, sworn Law Enforcement officers must report which agency they are employed by to the state.

Although TGS's intention is to only include locations associated with agencies that meet the above definition, TGS has discovered a few locations that are associated with agencies that are not publicly funded. TGS deleted these locations as we became aware of them, but some may still exist in this dataset.

Personal homes, administrative offices, and temporary locations are intended to be excluded from this dataset; however, some personal homes of constables are included due to the fact that many constables work out of their homes.

TGS has made a concerted effort to include all local police; county sheriffs; state police and/or highway patrol; Bureau of Indian Affairs; Bureau of Land Management; Bureau of Reclamation; U.S. Park Police; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; U.S. Marshals Service; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; National Park Service; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

This dataset is comprised completely of license free data.

FBI entities are intended to be excluded from this dataset, but a few may be included.

The Law Enforcement dataset and the Correctional Institutions dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes.

With the merge of the Law Enforcement and the Correctional Institutions datasets, the NAICS Codes &amp;amp; Descriptions were assigned based on the facility's main function which was determined by the entity's name, facility type, web research, and state supplied data. In instances where the entity's primary function is both law enforcement and corrections, the NAICS Codes and Descriptions are assigned based on the dataset in which the record is located (i.e., a facility that serves as both a Sheriff's Office and as a jail is designated as [NAICSDESCR]="SHERIFFS' OFFICES (EXCEPT COURT FUNCTIONS ONLY)" in the Law Enforcement layer and as [NAICSDESCR]="JAILS (EXCEPT PRIVATE OPERATION OF)" in the Correctional Institutions layer).

Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

"#" and "*" characters were automatically removed from standard fields that TGS populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields.

Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.

All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based on the values in this field, the oldest record dates from 04/26/2006 and the newest record dates from 10/19/2009 </abstract>
			<purpose>This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.</purpose>

			<attraccr>Attribute information remains the same as given by the author of the data. However, when information is missing or ambiguous, the GIS Information Systems Center at Tufts University researches other metadata sources for explanations. If sufficient information is unavailable, "unknown attribute" is given as the definition. If the attribute has been created through a geoprocesssing function, "geoprocessed identifier" is given. If the attribue is known, but the values are not, "unknown" is given for values. Features' units of measurement are determined if not already given. 

For entities that were contacted, the name, address, city, state, and five (5) digit zip codes were verified to be correct as of the date indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. The existence of the entity was also verified, as well as whether or not it met the criteria for inclusion in this dataset. Four (4) digit zip code extensions were derived from USPS (United States Postal Service) data and were not verified.

ID Check: The [ID] field is not blank and each of its values is unique.

Coordinate Check: Coordinates are not null or zero and the [X] and [Y] fields match the shape.

Basic Address Check: Physical addresses were verified to be non blank and to not be a "PO Box", "General Delivery", "Highway Contract", or "Rural Route" address.

Highway Address without Type Check: Physical addresses containing the word "Highway" or "Route" were verified to also contain a type designator such as "State", "US", or "County", if one actually exists for the highway or route. These type designators are often missing from addresses, leading to confusion if more than one "Highway" of the given number exists in an area.

Basic Name Check: Entity name is not blank, is not the same as entity city, and has a minimum of two (2) characters. Name does not contain punctuation characters that can interfere with database operations, such as " (quote) and * (asterisk).

City Check: Entity's [CITY] field is not blank, and entity is located within 25 miles of its tabular city as found in the NAVTEQ Named Places reference file.

State Check: The entity is located within its tabular state.

County Check: The entity is located within its tabular county.

FIPS Check: The tabular FIPS Code matches the entity's tabular county and tabular state.

County in Name vs. Geographic Location Check: If an entity's [NAME] field contains the word "county" or "co", the same county value should also be in the entity's [COUNTY] field.

Basic Phone Check: All phone numbers (including the area code) are ten (10) numeric digits. Alphabetic characters have been converted to the corresponding numeric digit.

NPA_NXX Check: Area codes (sometimes called "Number Planning Areas", or NPA's) and central office codes (sometimes known as exchanges, or NXX's) were validated against data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA). In some cases, NPA-NXX combinations did not show up in the NANPA data but were verified to work.

Area Code Distance Check: The entity's area code (NPA) is valid, and the entity is not more than 25 miles from its area code boundary, as defined by data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA), unless TGS has previously verified that the phone number rings to a headquarters location or otherwise does not ring to the entity's location.

Zip Code Check: The entity's zip code is five (5) or nine (9) numeric digits, is listed in the postal database, is in the same state as indicated by the entity's [STATE] value, and is not a PO Box only zip code.

Zip City Check: The entity's zip code and its city were verified to match according to the USPS Address Information System (AIS).

Zip Code Distance Check: The entity is located within 25 miles of its zip code boundary, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau's 1999 Zip Code file.

NAICS Code Check: The NAICS field is not blank, the NAICS Code is one of the accepted codes for this layer, the NAICS Description is an acceptable Index Entry for the NAICS Code, and certain key words in the entity name do not conflict with the NAICS Code.

Collocation Check: Entities with different addresses must not share the exact same geospatial location.

Geographic Spell Check: Words that appear in the entity name were checked against a standard English word list (and Spanish word list for entities in Puerto Rico). Words not appearing in these standard word lists were then checked against names appearing in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) of geographic features that are located within 25 miles of the entity. Proper names were manually reviewed for correct spelling.

Supplied Coordinates Distance Check: Entity is located within 3 miles of coordinates supplied by the original source.</attraccr>

TGS has made a concerted effort to include all local police; county sheriffs; state police and/or highway patrol; Bureau of Indian Affairs; Bureau of Land Management; Bureau of Reclamation; U.S. Park Police; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; U.S. Marshals Service; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; National Park Service; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in New Hampshire.

Correctional institutions are included in this dataset because they also serve as a police or sheriff's office, not because they have staff with arrest powers.

Personal homes, administrative offices, and temporary locations are intended to be excluded from this dataset; however, some personal homes of constables are included due to the fact that many constables work out of their homes.

The geographic location of entities was verified to be correct relative to the street vendor and version indicated by the [ST_VENDOR] and [ST_VERSION] fields. The horizontal accuracy is indicated by the [GEOPREC] field. A value of "BLOCKFACE" indicates the entity was geocoded on the correct street segment (block) and correct side of the street. A value of "ONENTITY" indicates that the location is on the entity's facility, as determined by USGS DOQQ imagery, and that it is on the correct street segment (block) and correct side of the street. Entities that are part of a larger institution (e.g., University Campus or Military Base) with "BLOCKFACE" precision may be located at the main entrance to the larger institution.

Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

1) The Correctional Institutions dataset and the Law Enforcement dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes.

2) Entities were processed to determine or verify their name, physical address, city, state, five (5) digit zip code, phone number, and geospatial location. Entities that were contacted were also asked if they provided law enforcement services, correctional institution services, or both. Entities not located on military bases were contacted and asked to describe their location relative to landmarks in reference data (mainly streets) and features visible in ortho imagery. A phone number was not available for some entities, so their information was verified using other verbal contacts made through a telephone call.

3) Due to a request made by the Department of Defense, TGS made every effort to not contact military bases starting 03/27/2007 and ending 05/28/2008. During this time, entities located on military bases were verified through alternate resources, such as maps and ortho imagery. These records have not been contacted by TGS, and therefore, do not have directions.

4) All text fields were set to all upper case.

5) Leading and trailing spaces were trimmed from all text fields.

6) Non printable and diacritic characters were removed from all text fields.

				<enttypl>Law Enforcement Locations in New Hampshire</enttypl>
				<enttypd Sync="TRUE">
Any location where sworn officers of a law enforcement agency are regularly based or stationed.

Law enforcement agencies "are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers". This is the definition used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Although LEMAS only includes non Federal Agencies, this dataset includes locations for federal, state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies.

Law enforcement agencies include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, state police, school police, park police, railroad police, federal law enforcement agencies, departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement (e.g., US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g., Port Authority Police).

In general, the requirements and training for becoming a sworn law enforcement officer are set by each state. Law Enforcement agencies themselves are not chartered or licensed by their state. County, city, and other government authorities within each state are usually empowered by their state law to setup or disband Law Enforcement agencies. Generally, sworn Law Enforcement officers must report which agency they are employed by to the state.

				<attrlabl Sync="TRUE">CITY</attrlabl>

The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a "city" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as "undeliverable"). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city, rather, they list the city as having "General Delivery". In these cases, the city and associated zip code are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] field will contain a street address, not "general delivery"). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the "city" specified in its [CITY] field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases, the "city" that appears in this field may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable "city" to the USPS. An example of this is "Notre Dame, IN". There is no city in Indiana called "Notre Dame", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located in the city of South Bend. "Notre Dame", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS "city" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable "city" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.

				<attrdef>NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Description for entity. The "Index Entries" that appear on the NAICS webpage (http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html) are being used to populate this attribute as opposed to the "NAICS Title". While there is a one to one correspondence between NAICS Codes and "NAICS Titles", there is a one to many relationship between NAICS Codes and the "Index Entries". By using the "Index Entries", we have placed the entities that make up this layer into more specific categories; however, the user of this data should be aware that this was not the intended purpose of these "Index Entries". The "Index Entries" were intended as a way to search the NAICS database and as a way of enumerating ways in which establishments falling under the given NAICS Code may be named. Thus, there are often two or more "Index Entries" that are synonyms, for example: "Prisons" and "Penitentiaries". In cases like this, we have standardized on one "Index Entry".  NAICS Descriptions (and NAICS Codes) have been assigned based upon the entity's primary function, regardless of the function that qualified it to be included in this dataset.</attrdef>

						<edomv>JAILS (EXCEPT PRIVATE OPERATION OF)</edomv>
						<edomvd>
JAILS (EXCEPT PRIVATE OPERATION OF) - [NAICS Code 922140]: Entity is a jail. A jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond arraignment (usually 72 hours) and prior to sentencing. Jails may also hold inmates serving short sentences (up to a year) for minor crimes. This includes locally administered jails that are staffed by municipal or county employees. This also includes regional jails operated for two or more jail authorities and Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities that function as jails.

The above definition is consistent with that used by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) Census of Jails (&amp;lt;http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cj99.pdf&amp;gt;), except that the BJS includes "private jails operating under contract to governments".

Also included under this category are temporary holding facilities, sometimes referred to as "police lock ups" or "drunk tanks". Temporary holding facilities are used to detain people prior to arraignment. Although these are included under this category, the BJS excludes them from their Census of Jails.

				<attrlabl>ORI</attrlabl>
				<attrdef>
The ORI is a nine-character identifier assigned by FBI CJIS staff to an agency which has met the established qualifying criteria for ORI assignment to identify the agency in transactions on the NCIC 2000 System. The structure of law enforcement ORIs (those ORIs ending with a zero) and other criminal justice ORIs (those ORIs ending with an alphabetic character) are as follows:

1. POSITIONS 1 THROUGH 5&amp;gt;Positions 1 and 2 are the alphabetic characters representing the state or country in which the agency is located.
For example: PA0040100
Positions 3, 4, and 5 are numeric characters indicating the county in which the agency is located.
For example: PA0040100
Exceptions to this are some state-level and federal agencies, which have the acronym for that agency, or alphabetic variations thereof, in positions 3, 4, and 5, i.e., DCATF0000 and TXDPD0000 for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Dallas, Texas, Police Department, respectively.

2. POSITIONS 6 THROUGH 9 OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ORIs
The criterion FBI CJIS staff uses for assigning a law enforcement ORI (one ending with a zero) is that the agency is a governmental agency or subunit thereof having statutory power of arrest and whose primary function is that of apprehension and detection.
Positions 6 and 7 in a law enforcement ORI are used to distinguish one agency from another within the same county.
For example: PA0040100
Positions 8 and 9 of a law enforcement ORI are always double zero. NCIC 2000 users, particularly large city/urban police departments, may vary the last two positions (8 and 9) to identify internal divisions, units, substations, or multiple terminals for the same agency within the same city. Any variation of the last two positions is acceptable with the exception that an alphabetic character cannot be used in position 9. NCIC 2000 does not assign these variations. The variations will not translate when a ZO inquiry is made.

3. POSITIONS 6 THROUGH 9 OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE ORIs
FBI CJIS staff determines the numeric and alphabetic characters assigned to positions 6 through 9 for criminal justice ORIs as follows: Positions 6 and 7 are numeric characters uniquely distinguishing one agency from other agencies of the same type and level within the same county. They do not indicate location (e.g., city) of the agency.
For example: PA004023C
Position 8 is a unique numeric character indicating the government level of the agency:
1 - Local, Municipal, City
3 - County
5 - State
7 - Federal
9 - Nongovernmental
For example: PA004023C
Position 9 is an alphabetic character representing the type of agency:
A - Prosecuting Attorney's Offices (includes District Attorney's Offices, Attorney General's Offices,  etc.).
B - Pretrial service agencies and pretrial release agencies.
C - Correctional Institutions (includes jails, prisons, detention centers, etc.).
D - Civil Courts for use in domestic violence and stalking cases.
E - Nongovernmental railroad or campus police departments qualifying for access to III. (This section  provides criteria for assignment of a limited access ORI.)
G - Probation and Parole Offices.
H - Department of State National Visa Center.
I - INTERPOL.
J - Courts and Magistrates Offices.
K - Medical examiners and coroners offices for access to Missing Person and Unidentified Person Files.
M - Custodial facilities in medical or psychiatric institutions and some medical examiners' offices which are criminal justice in function.
N - Regional dispatch centers which are criminal justice agencies or under the management control of criminal justice agencies.
O - National Insurance Crime Bureau.
P - Nongovernmental agencies that qualify for access to some NCIC 2000 files other than III. Also, 911 centers that do not have a management control agreement.
Q - Department of Housing and Urban Development approved Public Housing Agencies.
R - Agencies authorized by Public Law 99-169 for national security purposes.
U - Federal and state governmental child support enforcement agencies.
V - Department of Motor Vehicles.
W - National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).
Y - Local, county, state, or federal agencies that are classified as criminal justice agencies by statute but do not fall into one of the aforementioned categories, e.g., Arkansas Crime Information Center.
For example: PA004023C
